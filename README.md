*Summarize the project and what problem it was solving*

This program allows users to track and manage the frequencies of grocery items from an input file.
It uses a map structure to store the item frequencies, enables user input to search for an item,
display item frequencies, display a histogram, and backs up data to the frequency.dat file. The
main problem it solves is enhancing management and visualization of item frequencies.

*What did you do particularly well?*

I think that the menu system with the switch-case statements is the most commendable section of
the program that I completed.

*Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?*

I could implement input validation to handle invalid user input, such as invalid item searches or even non-string
input.

*Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?*

The code I found most challenging to work with was correct file handling. I had done a file conversion assignment before and it was easy to do, but for
some reason in this program, it got challenging. That was when I had to learn to map items. After doing a great deal of research, I was able to implement
the right method, and managed to get the program to function, but there still was a problem. The files were not converting like they should. I then realized
I forgot to add the method to close the files. After that, it was good to go! The tools I might add to my support network will be exploring techniques in
memory management pertaining to C++ to make sure my programs are able to handle large files without causing memory leaks.

*What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?*

Using map structures and designing classes for encapsulation are skills that will always be transferrable to other projects and course work.

*How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?*

I have made this achievement by using proper naming conventions such as "getFrequency", "displayList", "displayHistogram", and "backupFile", as well as adding
in-line comments to describe each method and how it functions. In that way, I was also able to demonstrate a modular approach to programming. The simple menu 
system allows users to use the program flexibly. If I wanted to, I could add more options to the menu and maintain the codebase as it is without having to rewrite 
the whole program.
